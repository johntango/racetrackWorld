# Simple 2D Racetrack Environment with Q-Learning Agent

## Overview
This Python script provides a simple demonstration of reinforcement learning using a Q-learning algorithm in a basic 2D racetrack environment.

## Components

### Environment: `RaceTrack`
- Defines a simple racetrack with drivable areas, start, and finish positions.
- Methods:
  - `reset()`: Resets the car to the starting position.
  - `step(action)`: Updates the car's position based on the action and returns the new position, reward, and whether the finish line is reached.
  - `render()`: Visualizes the racetrack and car's position using matplotlib.

### Agent: `Agent`
- Implements a basic Q-learning algorithm.
- Attributes:
  - `epsilon`: Exploration rate.
  - `alpha`: Learning rate.
  - `gamma`: Discount factor.
- Methods:
  - `choose_action(state)`: Chooses an action based on the current policy.
  - `learn(state, action, reward, next_state)`: Updates Q-values based on the observed transition.

### Training Function: `train_agent`
- Trains the Q-learning agent over a specified number of episodes.

## Running the Script
- Ensure numpy and matplotlib are installed (`pip install numpy matplotlib`).
- Run the script directly to train the agent and visualize its path on the racetrack.

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Visualization
- The racetrack visualization represents:
  - Gray area: Drivable area.
  - Black area: Non-drivable boundary.
  - Bright areas: Car position (2) and finish line (3).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
